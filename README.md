# orientation

Platform used to conduct new hire orientations.

## Usage

### Development mode

To run in development mode, run `./watch` and `./start` in two terminal windows.

This starts up two servers: 1) Hosting the javascript generated by webpack/babel with hot updating. 2) Hosting the web routing.

### Production mode

To prep for production, run `./pack` to generate the actual javascript file with webpack/babel.
